Android screen recorder for experiementing with people with ID

Benoit Favre, QUT, 2019

This app is a simple fullscreen activity recorder for Android, created for easily recording user activity when experimenting. Enable show touches in developer menu to see user input. The app records video from the screen and audio from the microphone. The resulting file is saved on sdcard in the Recordings folder.
Recording needs to be stopped explicitly with the "stop recording" button. When recording, a screencast icon is shown in the notification area.
